Data manipulation commands

These commands will work on the table related to data manipulations such as putting data into a table, retrieving data from a table and deleting schema, etc.

The commands come under these are

    - -> Count
    - -> Put
    - -> Get
    - -> Delete
    - -> Delete all
    - -> Truncate
    - -> Scan 

------
Count
------
    
Syntax: hbase> count <'tablename'>, CACHE =>1000

The command will retrieve the count of a number of rows in a table. 

The value returned by this one is the number of rows.
        
Current count is shown per every 1000 rows by default.
        
Count interval may be optionally specified.
        
Default cache size is 10 rows.
        
Count command will work fast when it is configured with right Cache.

---------
Truncate
---------

After truncate of an hbase table, the schema will present but not the records. 

This command performs 3 functions

   1.  Disables table if it already presents
   2.  Drops table if it already presents
   3.  Recreates the mentioned table 

Syntax: hbase> truncate <tablename> 

---------
Scan
---------

Syntax: hbase>scan <'tablename'>, {Optional parameters}

This command scans entire table and displays the table contents.

We can pass several optional specifications to this scan command 
to get more information about the tables present in the system.
   
scanner specifications may include one or more of the following attributes.

These are TIMERANGE, FILTER, TIMESTAMP, LIMIT, MAXLENGTH, COLUMNS, CACHE, STARTROW and STOPROW.

Cluster Replication Commands
------------------------------

These commands work on cluster set up mode of HBase.

For adding and removing peers to cluster and to start and stop replication these commands are used in general.

- - > add_peer
	
Add peers to cluster to replicate

hbase> add_peer '3', zk1,zk2,zk3:2182:/hbase-prod

- - > remove_peer
	
Stops the defined replication stream.

Deletes all the metadata information about the peer

hbase> remove_peer '1'

- - > start_replication
	
Restarts all the replication features

hbase> start_replication

- - > stop_replication
	
Stops all the replication features

hbase>stop_replication
